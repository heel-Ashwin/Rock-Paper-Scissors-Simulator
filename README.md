# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Simulator

This is a basic code to simulate the game of rock-paper-scissors.
The basic rules for the game are as follows:
Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it.
Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
Agree ahead of time whether you’ll count off “rock, paper, scissors, shoot” or just “rock, paper, scissors.”
Use rock, paper, scissors to settle minor decisions or simply play to pass the time.

In this simulator,a user and an opponent can choose any one of the options and the compilor will simulate the game to provide an ultimate winner.
